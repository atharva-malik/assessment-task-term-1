ADD MORE STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING: Rather than simply calculating the offer from the Banker as the average of the remaining values,
students could implement more complex and strategic decision-making algorithms to make the game more challenging.

ADD VISUAL OR AUDIO EFFECTS: Students could add visual or audio effects to make the game more engaging, such as images of the briefcases
or sound effects when a briefcase is opened or when the player decides.

As it is not possible to add traditional visual or audio effects in a console-based script since the console is limited
to displaying text and accepting text input. However, you can still enhance the visual and audio experience within these constraints.

VISUAL EFFECTS:

Colour the text: You can use ANSI escape codes to change the color of the displayed text, 
making it more visually appealing and easier to distinguish between different types of information. [EASY!]

Use ASCII art: ASCII art is a way to create images using only text characters. You can use ASCII art to represent briefcases, money, and other game elements. [HARD!!!]

Format the text: Use text formatting such as bold or underline to highlight important information or decisions. [EASY!]

Implement a high score system: Add a high score system to track the playerâ€™s performance and encourage repeat play. 
High scores could be based on the amount won, the number of rounds played, or other criteria. [MEDIUM!!]

Allow for multiple players: Modify the game to allow for multiple players, each taking turns to choose and eliminate briefcases and make decisions.
This would add a competitive element to the game. [HARD!!!]

Add a tutorial or practice mode: add a tutorial or practice mode to help new players learn how to play the game and to allow
experienced players to test out different strategies without impacting their scores. [HARD!!!]
